### (0.1) How to calculate the greatest common divisor and-least common-multiple of a given pair of numbers?

The GCD an acronym for Greatest Common Divisor, is the largest number that divides into a pair of given numbers. How may this be calculated? The greatest common divisor of a given pair of numbers may be calculated through firstly finding the divisors of the given numbers. For instance the divisors of sixty would be [1,2,3,4,5,15,...],whilst the divisors of say forty-five would be [1,2,3,5,9,15,...]. Through following the above metholodgy and finding the divisors of the given pair of numbers, the first part or step is completed (done), the next step would be to find the correlation between the two lists grafted, essentially finding the greatest number that these two lists share in common. In this example the GCD is 15.


Whilst the Greatest common divisor as explained briefly in the above paragraph deals with division and finding the greatest common number (divisor), LCM which stands for Lowest Common Multiple relates to the smallest number that is a multiple of both given pair of numbers.For instance the multiples of 6 are [ 6, 12, 18, 24, 30,...], whilst the multiples of 8 are [8, 16, 24, 32, 40,...], therefore it is possible to deduce that the lowest common multiple of the given pairs of numbers (in this example 6 and 8) is 24, as it is the lowest integer that may be multipled into both numbers.
