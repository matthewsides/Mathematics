### (0.0) Introduction 

This repository documents information relating to  mathematical methodologies, ideology's and questions that have been defined, answered and documented. 


### (0.1) How to calculate the greatest common divisor and-least common-multiple of a given pair of numbers?

The GCD an acronym for Greatest Common Divisor, is the largest number that divides into a pair of given numbers. How may this be calculated? The greatest common divisor of a given pair of numbers may be calculated through firstly finding the divisors of the given numbers. For instance the divisors of sixty would be [1,2,3,4,5,15,...],whilst the divisors of say forty-five would be [1,2,3,5,9,15,...]. Through following the above metholodgy and finding the divisors of the given pair of numbers, the first part or step is completed (done), the next step would be to find the correlation between the two lists grafted, essentially finding the greatest number that these two lists share in common. In this example the GCD is 15.


Whilst the Greatest common divisor as explained briefly in the above paragraph deals with division and finding the greatest common number (divisor), LCM which stands for Lowest Common Multiple relates to the smallest number that is a multiple of both given pair of numbers.For instance the multiples of 6 are [ 6, 12, 18, 24, 30,...], whilst the multiples of 8 are [8, 16, 24, 32, 40,...], therefore it is possible to deduce that the lowest common multiple of the given pairs of numbers (in this example 6 and 8) is 24, as it is the lowest integer that may be multipled into both numbers.

### (0.2) What is the probability of a random integer being divisible by 5?

The probability of a random integer being divisible by 5 is 1/5 how do we know this is plausable?, this is because every fifth number is divisible by 5 essentially meaning that every number that ends with either a 0 or 5 can be divided by 5 e.g 5 10 15 20 (numbers in the five timetable), which is every one in five number.Whilst all other numbers in between {0,1,2,3,4} are not probable to equate or be divisible by the random integer, giving the same value of 1 / 5 (note: the equavilance classes {0,1,2,3,4} cannot nor will have the same probality as 5 when dividing by a random integer as it is just not feasable).


Therefore to look at this from another perspective we need to understand that we cannot generate a random number and only create the appearance of random selection from a finite or select amount of possibilities  repeatedly, whilst increasing the size of the finite set of numbers (note:since the parameters or range of numbers are set) to ensure a different outcome each time.

### (0.3) Algorithm to calculate Arithmetic and Geometric Progression

Objective- Create a Program capable of calculating the Arithmetic and Geometric Progression of an inputted number.

Aims- [Take Input, Display Output, Loop multiple times, Calculate Arithmetic and Calculate Geometric.]

Language/ID : C++, Repl.IT 

Algorithm:

// Take a number (integer | input).

// Multiply the number (input) by itself (Operator *).  

// Inconjunction use addition to merge or double (Add) the number (input) by itself (Operator +).

// Loop said functions displayed above until set variable equal to a pre-set value (re-do the above multiple times).

// Give the final values once the calculations are done (Print the values).

// Presenting or showing the progression of values.

// The * relates to the Geometric, whilst the + is linked to calculating the Arithmetic.

View Notepad file labelled 'Calculator-arithmetic-geometric' for code-snippet pertaining to the above documentation.

For the Download, ZIP the repository and then extract the required files copying and pasting the code into an ID (Inparticular; Repl.IT, Visual Studios, etc.) for testing. Recommended: Use the command line console whilst in both build mode and with the finished build.
